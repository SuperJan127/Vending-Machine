# ðŸ¥¤ Vending Machine Application

This is a console-based vending machine simulator created as an early group project in Tech Elevatorâ€™s Java bootcamp. It reinforces core object-oriented programming concepts in Java.

## Features

- Inventory loading from a CSV file
- User balance input and change calculation
- Purchasing items by slot code
- Transaction logging to a file
- Menu-driven user interface in the terminal

## Tech Stack

- Java
- File I/O
- OOP principles (inheritance, encapsulation)
- Basic testing with JUnit

## Notes

I worked on a team of two to build this application. It laid the groundwork for later backend work with state management and transaction flows.
